# tic_tac_toe_game
Tic Tac Toe is a simple and fun two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking one empty square at a time with their symbol: 'X' for one player and 'O' for the other. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three identical symbols.

If all nine squares are filled and no player has succeeded in forming a line of three symbols, the game ends in a tie, often called a "draw." It's a quick and strategic game, making it great for casual play or learning basic problem-solving skills.
